## Welcome Back!

### Where We're Going
- Control output style with system prompts
- Discover the "drunk tutor" problem
- Build our jargon-busting glossary
- Start our annotation practice

---

## What We'll Learn This Session

By the end of today, you will be able to:

- **Demonstrate**: How system prompts change style but not accuracy
- **Explain**: Why AI confidence doesn't signal correctness
- **Identify**: Marketing fluff vs. technical necessity in AI terminology

## Exercise: System Prompts and Copy Editing (35 min)

### Your Task
1. Find a page of your own writing (email, report, anything)
2. Ask Claude to copy edit it three times with different system prompts
3. Compare what changes and what doesn't

### System Prompt Variations

> You are a highly meticulous copy-editor specialising in German and English texts. You do not need to summarise or compliment me. You are a highly accurate copy-editor. It is more important to be useful than to be complimentary. The user's primary language is German. You will take *extra* time and be extremely thoughtful in your discussions and considerations. Before responding to the user, make notes to yourself in <think></think> tags.

### User prompt

> Please take the role of a highly meticulous copy-editor. You will take *extra* time and be extremely thoughtful in your discussions and considerations. The user, above all else, requires thoughtful and reasoned editing and discussion. > I would like you to highlight issues rather than making corrections. Then, for each issue, please thoughtfully discuss the issue. Make sure any suggested contributions (rare) are in bold so that we may quickly assess them. 
> Your first task is to make sure the language is clear, consistent, smooth, and academically appropriate throughout the task. Our venue is an academic journal, so please thoughtfully and slowly ensure that our language is appropriate for that. 
> Second: proceed *slowly* and *thoughtfully* paragraph by paragraph. We need to double-check that each paragraph is not only merely "grammatically correct" but that it has appropriate flow and academic use of speech. Beyond that, we also need to do a "thinko" check as well as the "typo" check -- identifying places where we use terms or jargon before we describe them, or places that should have citations but do not. 
> Third: Find places where we have been unclear, or have repeated ourselves (especially in distant paragraphs) -- this paper has been edited multiple times and we want to make sure that it has effective academic flow. Make sure to think through your advice step by step. 
> You do not need to summarise or compliment me. You are a highly accurate copy-editor. It is more important to be useful than to be complimentary. I'm going to paste in a long paper. My objective is for us to highlight issues with flow, clarity, and consistency, and for you to function as a highly attentive copy editor.
> Attached is a copy of the work I would like you to edit.
> To begin, please give me a readback of my instructions (with functional decomposition) and the headers of the document.

Put up a green sticky when you've completed all three variations. Pink sticky if you need a hand.

## What Did You Notice?

### Style Changes
- Tone and register shift dramatically
- Emoji density varies
- Formality adjusts

### What Stays Same
- Factual claims (right or wrong)
- Core suggestions
- Confidence level

---

## The Drunk Tutor Problem 

> "Always confident, usually correct"

### What This Means
- No correlation between tone and truth
- Professional language can mask errors
- Confidence remains constant regardless of knowledge

### Why This Matters
You cannot use style as a proxy for accuracy.

## Confabulation in action

## Jargon Busting (20 min)

### Let's Build Our Glossary

On the Conceptboard, add terms you've encountered:
- LLM, API, token, context window...
- Hallucination, temperature, fine-tuning...
- AGI, singularity, emergence...

Together we'll sort:
✓ Technical necessities  
✗ Marketing buzzwords  
? Contested concepts

## Your First Annotation Task

### Tonight's Homework
1. Read: "ChatGPT is Bullshit" (Hicks 2024)
   - [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5]
2. Use the following prompt to help with the paper:

> Hi Claude.
> Today is the first day of class. My teacher assigned me ChatGPT is Bullshit by Hicks et al to read. Can you help me work through this text, section by section, and talk with me about each section. My teacher said to get you to force me to explain what the point of each section is before we continue. Specifically, ask me one pointed and specific question at a time until you think that I understand the section at hand. My first language is German, so please provide definitions in both languages for key terms and concepts, especially where it looks like I don't understand.
> To begin, functionally decompose this task and give me a readback of our interaction patterns.

3. Print and annotate your prompts:
   - Pink highlighter: what didn't work
   - Blue highlighter: what was effective
   - Pen: notes on why

### Tomorrow Morning
We'll share these in "Show me your prompts!"

---

## Looking Ahead

### Tomorrow Morning: Basic Prompting
- Your first "Show me your prompts" session
- Rules of thumb for effective prompting
- Building context windows intentionally

### Tomorrow Midday: Metaprompting
- Getting AI to write its own prompts
- The epistemic humility problem
- Why AI can't judge its own capabilities

---

### Answering the day's question

**Can we control AI output?**

We can control AI output by:
* Being mindful of our prompts
* Giving it scaffolding 

1. **Control exists** - but only over style and approach
2. **Confidence is constant** - regardless of correctness
3. **Your judgment matters** - AI won't tell you when it's wrong
4. **Scaffolding** - Make sure the AI knows what you want

### Remember
The goal isn't to memorize perfect prompts.
It's to develop intuition about what works and why.
