## Welcome Back!

### Today's Focus
**The paradox of confidence without accuracy**

### Where We're Going
- Control output style with system prompts
- Discover the "drunk tutor" problem
- Build our jargon-busting glossary
- Start our annotation practice

---

## What We'll Learn This Session

By the end of today, you will be able to:

- **Demonstrate**: How system prompts change style but not accuracy
- **Explain**: Why AI confidence doesn't signal correctness
- **Identify**: Marketing fluff vs. technical necessity in AI terminology

---

## Exercise: System Prompts and Copy Editing (35 min)

### Your Task
1. Find a page of your own writing (email, report, anything)
2. Ask Claude to copy edit it three times with different system prompts
3. Compare what changes and what doesn't

### System Prompt Variations

TODO

### User prompt

TODO

Put up a green sticky when you've completed all three variations. Pink sticky if you need a hand.

---

## What Did You Notice?

### Style Changes
- Tone and register shift dramatically
- Emoji density varies
- Formality adjusts

### What Stays Same
- Factual claims (right or wrong)
- Core suggestions
- Confidence level

---

## The Drunk Tutor Problem (15 min)

> "Always confident, usually correct"

### What This Means
- No correlation between tone and truth
- Professional language can mask errors
- Confidence remains constant regardless of knowledge

### Why This Matters
You cannot use style as a proxy for accuracy.

---

## Confabulation in action

(TODO LLM lecture slides "General Purpose Transformer" example)

---

## Jargon Busting (20 min)

### Let's Build Our Glossary

On the Conceptboard, add terms you've encountered:
- LLM, API, token, context window...
- Hallucination, temperature, fine-tuning...
- AGI, singularity, emergence...

Together we'll sort:
✓ Technical necessities  
✗ Marketing buzzwords  
? Contested concepts

## Your First Annotation Task

### Tonight's Homework
1. Read: "ChatGPT is Bullshit" (Hicks 2024)
   - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5
2. Use the following prompt to help with the paper:

> Hi Claude.
> Today is the first day of class. My teacher assigned me ChatGPT is Bullshit by Hicks et al to read. Can you help me work through this text, section by section, and talk with me about each section. My teacher said to get you to force me to explain what the point of each section is before we continue. Specifically, ask me one pointed and specific question at a time until you think that I understand the section at hand. My first language is German, so please provide definitions in both languages for key terms and concepts, especially where it looks like I don't understand.
> To begin, functionally decompose this task and give me a readback of our interaction patterns.

3. Print and annotate your prompts:
   - Pink highlighter: what didn't work
   - Blue highlighter: what was effective
   - Pen: notes on why

### Tomorrow Morning
We'll share these in "Show me your prompts!"

---

## Looking Ahead

### Tomorrow Morning: Basic Prompting
- Your first "Show me your prompts" session
- Rules of thumb for effective prompting
- Building context windows intentionally

### Tomorrow Midday: Metaprompting
- Getting AI to write its own prompts
- The epistemic humility problem
- Why AI can't judge its own capabilities

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Control exists** - but only over style and approach, not accuracy
2. **Confidence is constant** - regardless of correctness
3. **Your judgment matters** - AI won't tell you when it's wrong

### Remember
The goal isn't to memorize perfect prompts.
It's to develop intuition about what works and why.
