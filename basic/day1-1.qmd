## Welcome to AI Summercamp!

### Today's Big Question
**Can we control AI output?**

### This Morning
- Get to know each other
- Set up our tools
- Define your learning goals with AI assistance
- Start building our shared "grimoire"

---

## What We'll Learn This Session

By the end of this morning, you will be able to:

- **Do**: Navigate Conceptboard and connect to AI tools
- **Explain**: What a "grimoire" is and why we're building one
- **Create**: A refined set of personal learning goals using AI

---

## Our Journey This Week

### Monday: Can we control AI output?
### Tuesday: How do we populate the context window?
### Wednesday: What can we verify?
### Thursday: When do things break?
### Friday: How do we work sustainably?

Each day builds on the last - we're learning both skills AND judgment.

## Introductions (20 min)

On the Conceptboard:
1. Write your name and background
2. Add one question you have about AI
3. Put a +1 on questions you share

Let's learn who's in the room and what we're curious about.

## The Grimoire Concept

**What**: Our collective spellbook of prompts
**Why**: Learn from each other's experiments
**How**: Document, annotate, iterate

Throughout the week:
- Save your prompts
- Note what worked/failed  
- Share discoveries
- Build on others' work

## Technical Setup

### Sticky note protocol

On your desk is a green and a pink sticky note. 

Green: "I am done with the task"
Pink: "I would like help"
Nothing: "I am happily working away, please wait for me."

### Getting Connected
1. Check your email for an API key
2. Open chatcraft.org
3. Enter your API key in the settings menu
4. Connect to Claude Sonnet 4

If you have an API key in your email put up a green sticky note now.

## Exercise: Ask Me One Question at a Time

Your first real AI interaction! We'll use this prompt:

[Prompt template to be added]

The AI will interview you to help refine your learning goals for the week. Notice:
- How it builds understanding gradually
- Which questions are helpful vs. not
- How your answers shape its questions

---

## What's Next?

### After the Break
- System prompts and control
- The "Drunk Tutor" problem
- Beginning our annotation practice

### Throughout the Week
- Daily "Show me your prompts" discussions
- Building complexity gradually
- Developing your judgment alongside skills
