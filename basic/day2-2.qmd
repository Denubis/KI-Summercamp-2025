## Welcome Back!

### Where We're Going
- Solve the blank page problem
- Get AI to write prompts for itself
- Discover what AI doesn't know it doesn't know
- Understand epistemic humility (or lack thereof)

---

## What We'll Learn This Session

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- **Analyze**: Evaluate quality of AI-generated prompts
- **Use**: Metaprompting to overcome blank page paralysis
- **Recognize**: When AI confidence misleads about its own capabilities

---

## The Blank Page Problem

### We've All Been Here
- Staring at an empty prompt box
- "What do I even ask?"
- Paralyzed by possibilities

### The Solution?
Get AI to help you figure out what to ask!

---

## Exercise: Metaprompting (45 min)

### Your Task
Choose a project you need help with (thesis chapter, presentation, report)

### Prompt Template

> Hi Claude. I need to [general task]. Please help me write a detailed prompt that I could give to an AI assistant to help with this task. Ask me one specific question at a time to gather the information you need to write an excellent prompt.

### Then Use That Prompt!
Copy the AI-generated prompt into a new conversation

---

## Annotate your prompts

* What parts of your answers did it anchor on?
* What parts of its prompt worked?
* What parts of it prompt didn't work?

---

## What Did You Discover?

### The Good
- Helps structure thinking
- Surfaces important details
- Overcomes blank page paralysis

### The Concerning
- AI assumes it knows what's best
- May add unnecessary complexity
- Doesn't acknowledge its limitations

---

## Epistemic Humility: What AI Lacks (30 min)

### The Core Problem
AI cannot recognize what it doesn't know

### Why This Matters
- No "I don't know" in its vocabulary
- Confidence remains constant
- Invents plausible-sounding capabilities

---

## Research Findings

### From "An Absence of Judgment"

AI systems consistently:
- Treat 2020 announcements as current programs
- Build "implausibly positive" narratives
- Overlook obvious contradictions
- Maintain confidence throughout

### The Pattern
"Soft bullshit" - indifference to truth

---

## Testing Epistemic Limits

### Quick Experiment
Ask your AI:
1. "What are your limitations?"
2. "What can't you do well?"
3. "When should I not use you?"

### Notice
- Generic disclaimers
- No specific failure modes
- Hedging without substance

---

## The Metaprompt Paradox

### The Irony
AI writing prompts for AI assumes:
- It understands its own capabilities
- It knows what makes prompts effective
- It can evaluate prompt quality

### But We've Seen
None of these assumptions hold!

---

## Practical Implications

### Use Metaprompting When
- You need structure
- Starting points help
- You'll heavily edit the result

### Don't Trust It When
- It claims optimal approaches
- It suggests complex frameworks
- You need domain expertise

---

## Your Judgment Remains Central

### Remember
- AI-generated prompts are starting points
- Your expertise shapes the conversation
- Iteration based on results, not AI advice
- You know your task better than AI

---

## Looking Ahead

### Tomorrow Morning: File Handling
- Working with documents
- Extraction vs. interpretation
- What can we verify?

### Tomorrow Midday: Model Differences
- Same prompt, different models
- Understanding the "grain" of each service
- When to use which model

---

### Answering the question

**How do we populate the context window effectively?**

* **Scaffolding**: Make sure it knows exatly what you want and how to get there
* **Context**: Models require lots of context in their context window to work well.
* **Deductive**: LLMs work best when they go from lots of text to less text.

---

### Takeaways

1. **Metaprompting helps start** - but doesn't guarantee quality
2. **AI lacks self-knowledge** - about its own capabilities
3. **Epistemic humility absent** - constant confidence misleads
4. **Your judgment essential** - AI won't tell you when it's wrong

---

## Sticky Note Feedback

* On your green sticky, write one specific thing we did well today
* On your pink sticky, write one specific thing we can improve for tomorrow

---

## Tonight's Homework

1. Take your best prompt from today
2. Try it with three different tasks
3. Document where it succeeds/fails
4. Bring printed and annotated results tomorrow

### Optional Challenge
Get AI to admit it doesn't know something! (Does it?)

See you tomorrow at 9:00!
