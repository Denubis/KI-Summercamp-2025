### Answering the Week's Questions

**Can we control AI output?** (Day 1)
Yes - through scaffolding and system prompts, but only style, not accuracy

**How do we populate the context window?** (Day 2)  
Deliberately - with clear structure, one task at a time, deductive not inductive

**What can we verify?** (Day 3)
Extraction yes, interpretation no - Ctrl+F is truth, confidence isn't

**How should we work?** (Day 4)
With managed state, verified outputs, and retained human judgment

**When do things break?** (Day 5)
When tasks require understanding, not pattern matching

---

### The Meta-Lesson

These aren't separate insights but one principle:

**AI tools are powerful mirrors that reflect our judgment back at us.**

They break when we forget they're mirrors.
They work when we provide what to reflect.
They fail when we mistake reflection for understanding.

### Your Journey Forward

You now have:
- A grimoire of working prompts
- A catalog of failure modes  
- Annotation skills for continuous learning
- A community of practice

You still need:
- Continuous adaptation as models change
- Vigilance against automation bias
- Commitment to human judgment

---

### Final Class Reflection

In groups of 4-5, discuss:

1. What's the ONE thing you'll do differently when working with AI?
2. What's the ONE thing you'll never trust AI with?
3. What's the ONE question you still have?

Share one insight per group with everyone.

---

### Long Discussion: What should we teach the next time we run this class?


* What should we do differently?
* What questions do you still have?


---

### Where to Go Next

- Continue annotating prompts
- Share discoveries in the community
- Test new models against your criteria
- Teach someone else what you learned

Remember: The goal isn't to master AI.
It's to maintain mastery over our own judgment.

### Thank You

Keep questioning.
Keep testing.
Keep your judgment central.
