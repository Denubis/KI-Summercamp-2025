## Integrated Elements

### Daily "Show Me Your Prompts" (15 min, Days 2-5)
**Marzano Objective**: 
- **Metacognitive**: Monitor and adjust prompting strategies based on peer examples

### Homework (knowing 95% won't complete)
- **Day 1**: Watch video for context (those who do gain advantage)
- **Day 2**: Annotate today's prompts
- **Day 3**: Read German "Judge not amused" case (find local example)
- **Day 4**: Add to grimoire

### Missing But Needed Somewhere
- Building outline from quotes (could replace part of Day 5.1?)
- German-specific examples (need throughout)
- Terms of Service discussion (homework or replace interface comparison?)
