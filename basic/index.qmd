## Course Overview

This intensive week introduces AI literacy through hands-on exploration, systematic annotation, and progressive skill building. Each day addresses a fundamental question about working with Large Language Models.

## Daily Structure

Each day consists of:
- **Morning session** (9:00-10:30): Skills development
- **Break** (10:30-11:00): Grimoire work and annotation
- **Midday session** (11:00-12:30): Critical discussions and judgment development

## Week at a Glance

### Day 1 (Monday, Sept 8): Can we control AI output?
- [Session 1: Welcome and Getting Started](day1-1.qmd) - Setup, introductions, goal setting
- [Session 2: The 'Confident' Assistant](day1-2.qmd) - System prompts, drunk tutor problem

### Day 2 (Tuesday, Sept 9): How do we populate the context window?
- [Session 1: Basic Prompting Foundations](day2-1.qmd) - Rules of thumb, annotation practice
- [Session 2: Metaprompting](day2-2.qmd) - Blank page problem, epistemic humility

### Day 3 (Wednesday, Sept 10): What can we verify?
- [Session 1: File Handling and Source Work](day3-1.qmd) - Extraction vs interpretation
- [Session 2: Model Differences](day3-2.qmd) - Service grain, failure patterns

### Day 4 (Thursday, Sept 11): How should we work?
- [Session 1: Research Infrastructure](day4-1.qmd) - State management, conversation strategy
- [Session 2: The Boring Important Stuff](day4-2.qmd) - Legal, ethical, privacy discussions

### Day 5 (Friday, Sept 12): When do things break?
- [Session 1: Breaking Things Systematically](day5-1.qmd) - Failure modes, evaluation criteria
- [Session 2: Synthesis and Next Steps](day5-2.qmd) - Reflection, community building

## Core Learning Objectives

By week's end, participants will:

1. **Understand fundamental concepts** - Context windows, tokens, confidence paradox
2. **Develop practical skills** - Prompting, verification, state management
3. **Recognize limitations** - Confabulation, model differences, failure patterns
4. **Build judgment** - When to use, when to avoid, how to verify

## The Grimoire

Throughout the week, we build a collective "spellbook" of prompts through:
- Daily "Show me your prompts" sessions
- Systematic annotation practice
- Shared documentation on Conceptboard
- Peer learning from successes and failures
