# KI Sommercamp 2025 - Course State

**Last Updated**: [Date]  
**Status**: Initial Design Phase  
**Instructor**: Dr. Brian Ballsun-Stanton

## Core Pedagogical Principle
Every exercise exposes an epistemological boundary between what students believe LLMs are versus what they actually are. Human judgment remains central throughout.

## Course Structure
- **Duration**: 2 weeks (Sept 8-19, 2025)
- **Format**: 2 sessions/day, 1.5 hours each (9am-12:30pm with break)
- **Week 1**: Basic Course (Sept 8-12)
- **Week 2**: Advanced Course (Sept 15-19)
- **Crumple zones**: End of each week

## Critical Dependencies
- Session 5 (confabulation) requires Session 2 (confidence vs accuracy)
- [TO MAP: Other dependencies]

## Open Questions for Next Chat
1. [ ] Specific epistemological boundaries for each Week 1 session
2. [ ] German-specific confabulation example for Session 5
3. [ ] Should Advanced Week include homework?
4. [ ] Project work vs continued instruction for Advanced Friday?
5. [ ] How to handle mixed expertise in same session?
6. [ ] Complete boundary definitions for all Advanced Week sessions
7. [ ] Productive failure triggers for each defined boundary

## Decisions from This Session
- **2025-01-11-meta-framework.md**: Single course-state file with refactor principle
- **2025-01-11-week1-sequence.md**: Interleaved theory/practice with progressive boundaries
- **Key insight**: Exercises probe edges to define shape (not teaching to center)
- **Grimoire concept**: Shared prompt collection as continuous documentation
- Productive failure over success theater
- Observable behavior over internal states
- Process documentation over outcome focus
- German context over generic examples
- Tool literacy over tool worship

## Next Actions
- [ ] Define all missing boundaries
- [ ] Create German-specific examples
- [ ] Map exercise dependencies
- [ ] Design failure triggers for each session
