# Decisions Requiring Documentation

## 1. Exercise Cuts
**Decision Required**: Confirm these cuts are acceptable
- Roleplaying exercise (CONFIRMED CUT)
- "How to keep up" discussion (CONFIRMED CUT)  
- German/English translation exercise (STATUS UNCLEAR)

**Rationale**: Time constraints, basics focus
**Risk**: Missing soft skills practice, sustainability planning

## 2. "Organization" Exercise Placement
**Decision Required**: Which organization activity?
- Building outline from quotes?
- AI for idea organization?
- Something else?

**Current allocation**: Not explicitly placed
**Options**:

- Integrate into bibliography exercise
- Cut entirely

## 3. Terms of Service Discussion
**Decision Required**: Where does this critical content go?
- Homework (low compliance risk)
- Replace interface comparison in Day 5.2

**Brian's note**: "More important than I realized"

## 4. German Contextualization
**Decision Required**: How to ensure German examples throughout
- Which exercises get German-specific variants?
- Local "judge not amused" case identification
- German confabulation examples needed

## 5. Homework Strategy
**Given**: 95% won't do homework
**Decision Required**: What's actually essential?
- Day 1: Video (advantage for those who watch)
- Day 2: Annotation practice
- Day 3: German legal case
- Day 4: Grimoire contribution

**Question**: Should we have in-class backup for critical homework?

**Decision Required**: Include or cut?
- If include: Where? (Day 5.1?)
- If cut: Loses scaffolding demonstration

## 7. Annotation Practice Distribution
**Current plan**: "Show me your prompts" daily + homework
**Decision Required**: Is this sufficient for skill development?
- Need structured annotation time in class?
- Peer annotation sessions?

## 8. File Handling Introduction

**Risk**: No prior practice
