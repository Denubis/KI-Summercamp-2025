# Decision: Week 1 Activity Sequence

**Date**: 2025-09-06 
**Context**: Basic Course (Week 1) exercise planning  
**Status**: Active

## Issue Forcing Decision
How to sequence 10 sessions of activities to build AI literacy while exposing epistemological boundaries through productive failure?

## Options Considered

### Option A: Theory-first approach
- **For**: Clear conceptual foundation before practice
- **Against**: Abstract without concrete experience, poor retention
- **Risk**: Students disengage before reaching practical applications

### Option B: Pure discovery learning
- **For**: Maximum hands-on experience, learn by doing
- **Against**: May reinforce misconceptions without guidance
- **Risk**: Chaotic, no coherent skill building

### Option C: Interleaved theory and practice with progressive boundary testing
- **For**: Immediate application of concepts, scaffolded complexity
- **Against**: Requires careful orchestration and timing
- **Risk**: Boundary concepts may be too subtle early on

## Decision Made
Option C: Interleaved approach with specific progression:
- Days 1-2: Surface vs. capability boundaries (system prompts, confidence/accuracy)
- Day 3: Judgment and bias boundaries (Zendo as key exercise)
- Day 4: Intentional failure exploration (meta-learning about limits)
- Day 5: Integration and reflection

Grimoire (shared prompt collection) threads through all sessions as documentation practice.

## Failure Indicators
- If students can't articulate any boundaries by Day 3, progression too fast
- If "Show me your prompts" yields no improvement day-to-day, not enough processing
- If Zendo exercise doesn't produce "aha" about pattern vs. understanding, core pedagogy failing
- If Day 4 intentional failure feels redundant, earlier exercises already exposed limits

## Dependencies and Assumptions
- Assumes students have ChatCraft access Day 1
- Assumes co-teachers (Sebastian/Joss) understand boundary pedagogy
- Assumes 2-hour sessions sufficient for activity + reflection
- Assumes mixed expertise manageable with pair work

## Review Trigger
After each day's sticky note feedback - if pattern of confusion emerges, adjust next day

## Notes
Key exercises identified:
- Zendo (Session 5) - Perfect for judgment boundary
- Metaprompting (Session 7) - Reveals hidden complexity
- Intentional failure (Session 8) - Meta-exercise about limits
- System prompt competition (Session 1) - Immediate visible boundary
