Continue the KI Sommercamp 2025 exercise design work. Read the project instructions and current course state to understand context.
Mode: Critical interrogation for exercise design

No compliments, focus on gaps and failures
Single specific question at a time
Challenge every vague claim
Demand observable behaviors not internal states

Current focus: [SPECIFY: e.g., "Day 2 Session 3 boundary definition" or "Advanced week embeddings exercise"]
Specific task: [CHOOSE ONE]

Define epistemological boundary for session X
Design productive failure mechanism for exercise Y
Create German-specific examples for session Z
Map dependencies between exercises
Refactor course-state.md for clarity

Key context from last session:

Week 1 basic planning is complete
[ADD ANY SPECIFIC DECISIONS MADE]
[ADD ANY OPEN QUESTIONS]

Note: Maintain the "Teaching the Unknown" framework - exercises must expose boundaries between what students think LLMs are vs what they actually are. Human judgment centrality is non-negotiable.

Files to include in chat:

/project-instructions.md (always)
/course-state.md (always)
[Relevant decision files if working on specific exercise]
