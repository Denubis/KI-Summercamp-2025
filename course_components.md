# KI Sommercamp 2025 - Shared Understanding of Course Components

## Infrastructure & Tools

### Conceptboard
- **What it is**: German-hosted collaborative whiteboard (GDPR-compliant, privacy-focused)
- **Purpose**: Central platform for grimoire creation and shared annotation
- **Key feature**: Real-time collaboration with data sovereignty

### ChatCraft
- **What it is**: Interface for API-based LLM interaction
- **Setup requirement**: Students need API keys (Activity 2, Day 1)

## Core Pedagogical Elements

### Grimoire
- **Structure**: Git flight rules style - posting prompts, annotating each other's prompts, discussing annotations
- **When**: Built throughout week, work happens during breaks
- **Purpose**: Collective knowledge repository, annotation practice vehicle

### "Show Me Your Prompts" 
- **Daily ritual**: First 15 minutes of each day after Day 1
- **Purpose**: Normalize good/bad prompts, provide feedback, share discoveries
- **Learning outcome**: Develop prompt quality assessment skills

## Exercises (With Time & Learning Focus)

### 1. System Prompt Exercise (Day 1.1, 35 min)
- **Core concepts**: System vs user prompt, context window, tokens (maybe)
- **Activity**: Copy editing task with emoji system prompt variation
- **Learning outcomes**: 
  - Differentiate system/user prompts
  - Understand context window as controllable space
  - Manipulate output "vibe" through system prompt
  - Follow instructor's prompt patterns
- **Definition of done**: Successfully changed output style while maintaining accuracy

### 2. "Ask Me One Question at a Time" (45 min needed)
- **Purpose**: Force extended engagement with frontier models
- **Process**: AI interviews student to build outline
- **Learning outcomes**:
  - Populate context window effectively
  - Experience pointed AI questioning
  - Break through preconceptions about AI capabilities
- **Note**: Multiplayer version (transcribe conversation) possible but time-intensive

### 3. Annotated Bibliography (Day 3, 50 min)
- **Task**: Single paper, extract block quotes for specific questions
- **NOT**: Summarization
- **Purpose**: Mundane utility - sophisticated copy searching
- **Learning outcomes**:
  - Use AI for verifiable extraction not synthesis
  - Check sources against claims
  - Understand epistemically limited approaches

### 4. Metaprompting (Early placement critical)
- **Two purposes**:
  1. Solve blank page problem
  2. Demonstrate LLMs lack epistemic humility
- **Activity**: Get AI to write prompts for future self
- **Learning outcome**: Understand what model creators think good prompts look like

### 5. Model Comparison (45 min)
- **Activities**: OCR, block quotes, or web search across models
- **Key concept**: "Grain" - what each service affords/implies
- **Specific**: AI Studio web search, pasting web pages
- **Learning outcome**: Models aren't identical, user must choose appropriately

### 6. Zendo (55 min)
- **What**: Inductive logic game with Looney Pyramids
- **Shows**: Models fail at induction
- **Teaching**: How to build evaluations, assess risk, determine model appropriateness
- **Learning outcome**: Understand evaluation criteria for model selection

### 7. Building Outline from Quotes
- **Relationship**: Second iteration of "Ask me one question"
- **Process**: Combine bibliography quotes + thesis from earlier exercises
- **Learning outcome**: Scaffold complex projects through iterative prompting

### 8. Making Things Fail (35 min)
- **Target failures**: Confabulation, RAG limitations, epistemic boundaries
- **Specific tool**: Copilot (limited context window demonstration)
- **Learning outcome**: Understand failure modes and triggers

### 9. Copy Editing
- **Status**: Has standard prompt that works well
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate immediate utility
- **Note**: Can be integrated into other exercises as needed

### 10. Roleplaying
- **Focus**: AI in lower-knowledge roles than user
- **Examples**: Evil Reviewer 2, synthetic client
- **Purpose**: Practice soft skills, pedagogical applications

### 11. Context/Feedback Loops with Git
- **Tools**: Claude.ai, Google Drive or Git integration
- **Shows**: Privacy-protecting workflow, persistent context
- **Includes**: Todo lists, project scaffolding
- **First step**: "Ask me one question" for project requirements

### 12. Working with Other Interfaces
- **Compare**: Claude.ai vs AI Studio vs others
- **Key lesson**: Interface shapes possibilities
- **Learning outcome**: Navigate interface implications

## Discussions

### Goals for the Week (Day 1.2, 15 min)
- **Purpose**: Adjust class, normalize curiosity, socialize inquiry
- **Not just**: What to teach
- **Also**: Where everyone is, appropriate questions

### How to Keep Up
- **Content**: RSS readers, news curation outside social media
- **Purpose**: Sustainable information diet for AI developments

### Terms of Service
- **Priority**: More important than initially thought
- **Links to**: Responsibility for outputs

### Judge Not Amused
- **Core message**: You are responsible for AI outputs
- **Evidence**: Legal cases where lawyers submitted AI hallucinations
- **Learning outcome**: Accountability doesn't transfer to AI

### What to Teach Next Time
- **Purpose**: Reflection on progress, feedback for iteration
- **Secondary**: Students realize how far they've come

## Lectures (Support for Exercises)

### Drunk Tutor
- **Concept**: Always confident, usually accurate
- **Source**: Your proleptic paper, LLM workshop part 1

### Basic Theory/Rules of Thumb
- **Time**: 20 minutes needed
- **Source**: LLM workshop part 2

### Common Misconceptions
- **Key points**: Training ≠ chatting, calculator for words, controllable knobs, text reduction
- **Source**: LLM workshop part 3

### Judgment/Epistemic Humility
- **Your research**: LLMs lack epistemic humility
- **Audience**: Academics will appreciate research discussion

### Productive Failure
- **Focus**: Iteration, learning from bad results
- **Embedded in**: Annotation practice throughout

### Keeping Up with Change
- **Practical**: How to track developments sustainably

## Homework (95% won't do it)

### Day 1
- Your one-hour video
- Poster handout on prompting
- Play with prompts

### Throughout
- Annotation of prompts (will become "Show me your prompts" content)
- Homework discussion needed to norm importance

## Missing/Needs Clarification

1. **German/English translation** - Dropped but you mentioned it helps German native speakers
2. **Building evals from Zendo** - You said "that's going to be hard" but included
3. **Pairs discussion** - Natural emergence or structured?
4. **Samplers lecture** - Mentioned (rentry.co/samplers#top-p) but placement unclear

## Critical Dependencies

- System prompts → Basic prompting → Metaprompting
- "Ask me one question" → Bibliography → Outline building
- Model comparison → Making things fail
- All exercises → Annotation practice (continuous)
