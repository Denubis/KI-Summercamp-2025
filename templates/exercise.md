# Exercise: [Name]

## Session Context
- **Day/Session**: Day X, Session Y
- **Course**: Basic/Advanced
- **Position in sequence**: Exercise N of 20

## Epistemological Boundary
- **Testing**: [What is vs. what isn't]
- **Inside boundary**: [LLM behavior that works as expected]
- **At boundary**: [Where behavior shifts/degrades]  
- **Outside boundary**: [Where LLM fails or misleads]

## Learning Objective
[Single, specific, observable outcome]

## Productive Failure Design
- **Misconception to break**: [Specific false belief students hold]
- **Trigger mechanism**: [What action causes the discovery]
- **Expected "aha" moment**: [The insight that should emerge]

## Observable Evidence of Learning
- **Before failure**: Student does [specific behavior]
- **After failure**: Student does [different behavior] instead
- **Verbal indicator**: Student says something like "[quote]"

## Activity Structure
### Setup (X minutes)
[Initial framing and instructions]

### Exploration (Y minutes)
[What students do independently/in pairs]

### Failure Point (Z minutes)
[Where the misconception should break]

### Debrief (W minutes)
[Group discussion of discoveries]

## Salvage Protocols
- **If confused**: [Simpler version of same boundary test]
- **If too easy**: [Harder version exposing deeper boundary]
- **If time runs out**: [Minimum viable lesson]

## Dependencies
- **Requires understanding from**: [Previous exercises]
- **Enables**: [Future exercises]
- **Assumes knowledge of**: [Specific concepts/tools]

## Local Context
- **German-specific element**: [Cultural/linguistic/institutional aspect]
- **Audience consideration**: [Adjustment for mixed expertise levels]

## Decisions Linked
- [YYYY-MM-DD-decision-name.md] - Why this boundary matters
- [YYYY-MM-DD-another.md] - Why this approach chosen

## Open Questions
- [ ] [Unresolved design issue]
- [ ] [Need input on X]

## Notes
[Any additional context for future refinement]
